My first personal site was using Gatsby. As I know NextJS more, I become more comfortable with its APIs 
and wanted to move my personal site to it.

This is the first blog post I am posting on the new site! ðŸŽ‰

## So what's in this post?

Nothing, really. If you are wondering how this is set up, take a look at this great article on 
Tailwind Blog: ["Building the Tailwind Blog"](https://blog.tailwindcss.com/building-the-tailwind-blog).
Most of the blog functionalities here currently is based on their implementations. I might play around 
with other approaches and if I do find a better approach for me, I might switch in the future.
