        This page is home to my thoughts on some topics. The idea came one day
        when I felt like I was getting asked similar questions quite often.
        Instead of answering them with a similar answer everytime, why not
        compile them at one place so they can be easily discoverable and
        shareable? It&apos;s kinda like{' '}
        <ExternalLink href="https://reactjs.org/docs/error-decoder.html/?invariant=425">
          React error page
        </ExternalLink>
        , where you can find answer for specific invariant error code, but for
        topics instead!

          I am a big believer of holding opinions loosely. Chances are my
          opinions on these topics will change as time passes, condition changes
          and/or I discover new information. When that happens, I might not
          always be able to keep my thoughts here up-to-date.

        <Paragraph className="text-inherit">
          All of these are just one guy&apos;s opinions, very likely to be
          biased and influenced by my own personal experience. Which is to say
          the things I say here might not be really applicable to others. With
          that being said, I do hope my perspectives can be helpful to a subset
          of people. <EmojiSpan>ðŸ˜„</EmojiSpan>
