title: What I do
---

## I work with web stuffs 🌐
I mainly work with JavaScript and all things related to the web ecosystem. Currently, I am working at [Tokopedia](https://www.tokopedia.com) in the web platform team.

## I write (kinda) 🗒
I have always been a curious person. I liked to learn things and understand how they work. Sometimes if I find the discovery interesting, I try to write an article about them to share them! 

Considering checking me out on [Medium](https://medium.com/@jackyef)!

## I build stuffs 🛠
I try to build things to help making my life easier. Some of them I published as an open source project on [GitHub](https://github.com/jackyef). I also contribute to open source libraries when I could.
