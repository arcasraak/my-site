      <Paragraph>
        I am a software engineer working on all-things-web. I am a curious
        person and I love to learn how things work, and why they are made the
        way they are. Most of my experience are with React and front-end
        development, but I like to strengthen fundamentals and concepts to allow
        me to learn other things easier, even if they are not necessarily
        closely related to front-end development. In my personal time, I try to
        get my hands on some new tools to learn more about them. I also applied
        some of the stuffs from my personal learning at work when feasible, some
        of them are:{' '}

        Currently I am working with JavaScript at{' '}
        <ExternalLink href="https://www.tokopedia.com">Tokopedia</ExternalLink>{' '}
        in the web platform team. Since July 2019, I have been part of the core
        team, working on things that help other developers in their work such
        as: development toolings, CIs, and monitoring tools. I also tinker
        around with build processes and maintain Tokopedia&apos;s web platform
        monorepo that houses 20+ services and 30+ reusable packages to which 80+
        developers are contributing daily. At Tokopedia, I work mostly with
        React, Node, TypeScript, GraphQL and Apollo.

        Before moving to the core team, I was part of the mobile web team. My
        day-to-day tasks include collaborating with backend engineers, product
        owners and designers to ship features and products in a timely manner.

        I have always been a curious person. I love to learn things and
        understand how they work. Sometimes if I find the discovery interesting,
        I try to write an article about them to share them!

      <Paragraph>
        Sometimes I am motivated to build stuffs. Some are just for fun and
        learning, some are actually kind of helpful. A lot are abandoned because
        I got sidetracked (don‚Äôt we all? üòÖ). I published them as open source
        projects on{' '}
        <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/jackyef">GitHub</ExternalLink>. I
        also contribute to open source libraries when I could.

        During the course of my career, I have been fortunate enough to be given
        some opportunities to give talks about web development and its
        ecosystem, both for internal and external audience. In 2020, I have
        given 2 internal talks at Tokopedia, one about JavaScript modules, and
        another one about JavaScript packages. I have also given 2 external
        talks representing Tokopedia at{' '}

        In the future, I am hoping to be more active in the community, giving
        more talks about the web. Who knows, I might add a <Code>/talk</Code> page
        on this site with the materials if it turns out to be a good idea!
